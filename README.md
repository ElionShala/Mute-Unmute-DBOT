# Mute-Unmute-DBOT
A discord bot which can mute and unmute members, if you have a certain role called "mute permissions".

Alrighty, now if you want to set this up on your server, you have to create your own bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications, create a new bot, and at the bot panel, you click on "Bot" option, there  you can disable public bot, PRESENCE INTENT, SERVER MEMBERS INTENT, and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT, you can give it administrator priviledges since it is your own bot, and save it. Then go to oauth2, and url generator, at scopes select BOT, and application.commands, the admin permissions, and it generates a link, get that link and using that, put it in your discord server, then download my files, theres also a .env file, you want to open with notepad, and at TOKEN = 0, replace the 0 with your own bot's token that can be found at bot panel, at BOT and Reset Token. At GUILD_ID, you need to right click your server and click Copy Server Id, and replace the 0 with your server ID. Then after that you want to ping the bot, send the message, and at the ping that you made just right click, and click copy id, replace the 0 with your bot's id, then you want to make a role named exactly "muted", set it's permissions so that it can't chat, and put it higher then your member role, and right click muted role, and copy id, at the .env file, you have MUTED_ROLE, and its equals to 0, replace the 0 with your muted role's id. Then you also want to create a role called exactly "mute permissions", anyone who has this role can use the /mute and /unmute command. ALSO IF YOU DO ANY OF THE STEPS WRONG, IT WILL NOT WORK, IF YOU DM ME IN MY DISCORD THATS BELOW, ILL COME AND HELP YOU, IF YOU WANT THE MUTE PERMISSIONS ROLE TO BE CALLED OTHERWISE, DM ME ON DISCORD, IT NEEDS CHANGING IN THE CODE TOO!
